name: error-handling
description: How to signal and handle failure - expected failures are returned as values, exceptions are reserved for genuinely exceptional conditions, and are never used for control flow or silently swallowed. USE FOR designing a function's failure signature, deciding whether to return an error or throw, writing a catch block, handling a failed external call, mapping errors at a boundary, or reviewing error paths. DO NOT USE FOR deciding what to log - see observability-standards.
